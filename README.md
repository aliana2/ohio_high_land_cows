a silly app dedicated to ohio highland cows and sweet treats!
i've been very dedicated to sweet treats lately and there is a pop-up in my area that has creative breads like blue corn bread. i also was introduced to the highland cow from the windows lock screen wallpaper! what a cutie. in combination of these two interests, as well as my fledgling android app making skills, this app was born! it was a bit of a struggle with the navigation bar bc that was new for me. my fav part is the app icon! it is so cute. i drew it on microsoft paint. my favorite part of the real app is the sweet treat page, with the cute cart thing and the yippee sound effects! yippee!
