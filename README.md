# a silly app dedicated to ohio highland cows and sweet treats!
i've been very dedicated to sweet treats lately and there is a pop-up in my area that has creative breads like blue corn bread. i also was introduced to the highland cow from the windows lock screen wallpaper! what a cutie. in combination of these two interests, as well as my fledgling android app making skills, this app was born! it was a bit of a struggle with the navigation bar bc that was new for me. my fav part is the app icon! it is so cute. i drew it on microsoft paint. my favorite part of the real app is the sweet treat page, with the cute cart thing and the yippee sound effects! yippee!

# how to use, you ask?
about page: read information about the cow, click cow picture to play cow moo sound
sweet treat page:  click on picture of sweet treats to add to cart (phone vibration, yippee noise), clear cart using clear cart button at the bottom if you want, see the prices and cart numbers go up! submitting with an empty field will give sad notification.
donate page:  put in your card information and click submit
totals! cart is reset and there is a thank you notification. you can see past card submissions for inspiration if you forget what a credit card looks like.
