    <string name="cow_fun_facts"><![CDATA[of course!! here are some funny & cute fun facts about Highland cattle 🐮💛 \n🧈 Their long, fluffy coats aren’t just adorable — they’re double-layered! A downy undercoat keeps them warm, and a long, wavy outer coat acts like a built-in raincoat. \n🌨️ Because they’re so well-insulated, Highland cattle don’t need as much body fat — which means they can stay cozy even in Scottish blizzards while looking like they’re dressed for a fashion shoot. \n💇‍♀️ Their “bangs” (called a dossan) protect their eyes from flies and snow — basically nature’s way of giving them stylish fringe. \n😎 Scientists joke that Highland cows invented the “emo haircut” long before humans did. \n🧡 They’re one of the oldest registered cattle breeds in the world — ancient and fabulous. \n🌿 Despite their majestic horns, they’re total softies — gentle, social, and known for being easygoing with humans and other animals. \n🐮 Calves look like teddy bears with legs. It’s scientifically impossible to look at one and not say “aww.” \n🍀 They can eat tough plants and thrive on poor-quality grass, making them the ultimate eco-friendly lawnmowers. \n🧊 Their tongues are so strong they can grab and strip bark off branches — Highland cows = buff gym bros of the pasture. \n💕 Some farmers say their cows recognize voices and will trot over if they hear someone they like (especially if snacks are involved). \n🌈 They come in more colors than you’d expect — red, yellow, black, dun, silver, and brindle — it’s like the cow version of a Skittles pack. \n🫶 When they’re happy, they wag their tails like dogs! \n🎶 If Highland cattle could talk, they’d probably have thick Scottish accents and excellent taste in folk music. \n💤 They love lying down in big “fluff piles” together to nap and stay warm — like a giant bovine cuddle puddle. \nwould you like me to make them sound a bit more like cute social media captions (e.g. for a carousel post or infographic)?]]></string>
